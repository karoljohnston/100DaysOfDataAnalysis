# 100DaysOfDataAnalysis
Hi! I'm starting this repository to track my improvement on my Data Analysis career. Please feel free to leave a feedback on how to make tasks easier! I believe that we improve as human if we get input from other people. &lt;3

Day 1 - 9AM: I made this repo. I signed in Kaggle to check out the new datasets! I'm on Day 5 streak - I lost my streak even though I was logging in everyday. Does anyone know why that happened? I will do more tasks today to improve my DA skills. Stay tuned
